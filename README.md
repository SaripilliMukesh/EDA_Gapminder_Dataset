Global Development Analysis Project

This project conducts an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on global development indicators, focusing on life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population trends from 1952 to 2007. Key analyses include pivot tables, data visualizations using Seaborn/Matplotlib, and identifying patterns such as the correlation between wealth and longevity, outliers in GDP distribution, and the effects of socio-economic factors on global health outcomes.
